This is the mobile app project done by GT Hacker 5. (Team members are: (Alphabetically) Cheng-Pang Chen, Qiang Fu, Fang he, Di Sun, Baiqian Zhang)

I decided to write this project in Ionic Framework, because I'm a big fan of Angular.js and Ionic can provide much better UI/UX.

How to run this project: step 1: install node.js

step 2: sudo npm install -g cordova ionic ios-sim

step 3: sudo ionic platform add ios

step 4: ionic build ios

step 5: ionic emulate ios
